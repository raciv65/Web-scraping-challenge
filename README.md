# Web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment, I build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.
The web pages scraped were the folloging:
<ul>
  <li>Nasa Mars New [(web page)](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/)</li>
  <li>JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image [(web page)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars)</li>
  <li>Mars Facts [(web page)(https://space-facts.com/mars/)</li>
  <li>Mars Hemispheres [(web page)](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)</li>
</ul>
