# Web-scraping-challenge

In this assignment, I build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.
The web pages scraped were the folloging:

  -Nasa Mars New [web page](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/)
  -JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image [web page](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars)
  -Mars Facts [web page](https://space-facts.com/mars/)
  -Mars Hemispheres [web page](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)
